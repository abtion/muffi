## What is Muffi?

Muffi is a project template maintained by [Abtion](https://abtion.com/) and used to kick start
Ruby on Rails applications.

## Key features

* Heroku ready - Review apps, staging and production
* Uses [devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise)
* Uses [Heroku CI](https://heroku.com)
* Uses [rspec](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-rails)
* Uses [simplecov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov)
* Uses [rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop)

## Getting Started

### Start a new project

To start a new project with Muffi, simply create a new repository on GitHub
using this repository as a template.

Alternatively, clone this repository and change the git remote to point to
your own repository.

### Configure the project

1. Edit `application.rb` and change the module name and configuration settings.
2. Edit the database names in `database.yml`
3. Use "search and replace" to replace project specific strings across all files:
   - PROJECT_DOMAIN => project-name.com
   - PROJECT_NAME_PARAM => project-name
   - PROJECT_NAME_PASCAL => ProjectName
   - PROJECT_NAME_SNAKE => project_name
   - PROJECT_NAME_HUMAN => Project name

   Note: The application name is wrapped around comments used to disable a rubocop check.
   When the application has been renamed, the comments should be removed.
   (See config/application.rb#L25-27)
4. `mv README.example.md README.md`

### Configure Code Climate

1. Login to CodeClimate and add your project
2. Go to `https://codeclimate.com/repos/<your-project>/settings/test_reporter`
3. Set up a Heroku pipeline.
4. `heroku config:set CC_TEST_REPORTER_ID=<Code Climate test reporter ID>`
5. Update https://codeclimate.com/repos/REPO_ID/settings/test_reporter to be at 100% diff coverage

### Configure CD

1. Log in to the [Heroku dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com)
2. Create a Pipeline, and two new applications
    - Staging: `<PROJECT-NAME>-staging`
    - Production: `<PROJECT-NAME>-production`
3. Turn on "Review Apps" from the Pipeline's page

### Setup mailing

1. Go to the production app in the Heroku dashboard.
2. Add Sendgrid addon.
3. Click the added Sendgrid resource, go through the confirmation steps.
4. Set up DKIM (under sender authentication -> domain authentication).
5. Go to staging and repeat the above steps.
6. If you want the review apps to send emails: Copy the staging app's Sendgrid credentials and add them to the review apps config vars. Do not add the Sendgrid addon to review apps in `app.json` (Sendgrid will ban our account).

### Capybara drivers

This project registers two Capybara drivers.

Set the environment variable `CAPYBARA_DRIVER` to `headless_chrome` (default) to run specs without
opening Chrome, or use `chrome` to open the browser automatically.
